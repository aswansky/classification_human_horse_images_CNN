# classification_human_horse_images_CNN
This code is design to binary classify images to either human or horse using convolution neural network  based on human-horse dataset from kaggle. data description https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset/data
a pretrained model " InceptionV3" is used to enhance performance and accuracy of the model 
Data augmentation is also adapted to simulate new images for training.
Model accuracy reached over 99% for both training and validation
